              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                At CareerCanvas, we're dedicated to empowering professionals with the knowledge, strategies, and inspiration they need to thrive in today's ever-changing work landscape. Whether you're climbing the corporate ladder, building a freelance business, or developing your personal brand, our goal is to provide actionable insights that drive real results.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                CareerCanvas began in 2020 when a group of career advisors, freelance consultants, and personal branding experts noticed a gap in the resources available to modern professionals. While plenty of career advice existed, much of it failed to address the realities of today's digital-first, rapidly evolving workplace.
              </p>
              <p>
                We set out to create a platform that combines cutting-edge research, practical strategies, and real-world success stories to help our readers navigate their professional journeys with confidence. What started as a small blog has grown into a comprehensive resource hub serving thousands of professionals worldwide.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Our Team</h2>
